==============================

This dataset was exported via roboflow.ai on June 6, 2021 at 11:16 AM GMT

It includes 985 images.
Actions are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -25 and +25 percent
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 5 percent of pixels
